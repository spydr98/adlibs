Once there was a '.$person2.' who wanted to '.$noun1.' a '.$person1.'. Only a real one would do. So he traveled
 through all the world to find her, and everywhere things went wrong. There were '.$person1.'s aplenty,
 but how was he to know whether they were real '.$person1.'s? There was something not quite right about
 them all. So he came home again and was '.$adj1.', because he did so want to have a real '.$person1.'.
<br />
One evening a terrible storm blew up. It lightened and thundered and rained. It was really frightful!
 In the midst of it all came a '.$verb1.' at the town gate. The old King went to open it.
<br />
Who should be standing outside but a '.$person1.', and what a sight she was in all that rain and wind.
 Water streamed from her hair down her clothes into her shoes, and ran out at the heels. Yet she
 claimed to be a real '.$person1.'.
<br />
"We\'ll soon find that out," the old Queen thought to herself. Without saying a word about it she
 went to the '.$room1.', stripped back the bedclothes, and put just one '.$noun2.' in the bottom of the
 bed. Then she took twenty '.$noun4.' and piled them on the '.$noun2.'. Then she took twenty eiderdown
 feather '.$noun3.' and piled them on the '.$noun4.'. Up on top of all these the '.$person1.' was to spend
 the night.
<br />
In the morning they asked her, "Did you sleep well?"
<br />
"Oh!" said the '.$person1.'. "No. I scarcely slept at all. Heaven knows what\'s in that bed. I lay
 on something so hard that I\'m '.$color1.' and '.$color2.' all over. It was simply terrible."
<br />
They could see she was a real '.$person1.' and no question about it, now that she had felt one '.$noun2.'
 all the way through twenty '.$noun4.' and twenty more feather '.$noun3.'. Nobody but a '.$person1.' could
 be so delicate. So the '.$person2.' made haste to '.$noun1.' her, because he knew he had found a real '.$person1.'.
<br />
As for the '.$noun2.', they put it in the museum. There it\'s still to be seen, unless somebody has taken it.
<br />
There, that\'s a true story.
