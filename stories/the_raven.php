Once upon a midnight dreary, while I '.$verb1.' weak and weary,
Over many a '.$adj1.' and '.$adv1.' volume of '.$verb2.' lore,
While I '.$verb3.', nearly napping, '.$adv2.' there came a tapping,
As of some one '.$adv3.' rapping, rapping at my '.$room1.' door.
"\'Tis some '.$person1.'," I muttered, "tapping at my '.$room1.' door
Only this, and nothing more."
<br />
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the '.$adj3.' December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its '.$noun1.' upon the floor.
'.$adv4.' I wished the morrow; vainly I had tried to borrow
From my '.$noun2.' surcease of sorrow; sorrow for the lost Lenore -
For the rare and '.$adj5.' whom the '.$noun3.' name Lenore -
Nameless here for evermore.
<br />
And the silken sad uncertain '.$noun4.' of each '.$color1.' curtain
Thrilled me; filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
"\'Tis some '.$person1.' entreating entrance at my '.$room1.' door
Some round '.$person1.' entreating entrance at my '.$room1.' door;
This it is, and nothing more."
